# OSINT-Tools-Iraq
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f6/Flag_of_Iraq.svg" alt="iraq_FLAG"/>
A list of OSINT resources and tools that may be useful to you when conducting investigations related to the Republic of Iraq. Some of the resources are available in English, Arabic, and Kurdish. Progress on open data in Iraq is slow but observable, with international support and some government engagement, but significant gaps (especially legal, technical, and political) remain. For up-to-date, reliable data, international agencies and major NGOs are often more current than official Iraqi sources. And don't forget about the Wayback Machine.
